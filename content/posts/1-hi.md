Hello world

## WHY??

Mark Manson mentions in his book, the subtle art of not giving a fuck, that he asked an unnamed author on secrets to writing tons of books. The prolific unnamed author replied "200 crappy words a day, that's it".

This is the start to writing my own 200 words per day, everyday. I have set it up in such a way that I can write this from anywhere in the world using any internet connected device. I have thought about writing for a long time now, I never got around to doing it. I think the art of writing is specially important in this age of AI. AI will get better but it must not replace human writing. 

In my opinion, writing is the most important tool humans have ever devised. If humans had never mastered the art of writing we would not be here. We would not have had any innovations that powers our modern life. We'd be sicker, dumber, and more miserable. Writing is what has allowed generations to pass down whatever they have learned to the next generation, so the next generation can build on top of the base built by the previous, without such mechanism I suspect human race could not thrive as it has today.

Lets start.
